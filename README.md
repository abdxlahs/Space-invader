# Space Invader Game

This is a simple Space Invader game developed using programming fundamentals concepts and some basic graphics library of C++. The game consists of a player spaceship and a group of enemy spaceships, with the player's objective being to shoot down all the enemy spaceships before they reach the bottom of the screen. 

## How to Play
* Use the arrow keys to move the player spaceship left and right
* Press the space bar to shoot lasers at the enemy spaceships

* Shoot down all enemy spaceships to win the game

## Dependencies
This game uses a few basic graphics functions, including:
* `graphics.h` for drawing shapes, lines, and text
* `windows.h` for setting the window background color and loading images


Make sure to have these libraries installed and properly configured before compiling the game.

## Getting Started
To get started, simply clone this repository and compile the `spaceinvader.cpp` file using a C++ compiler that supports the graphics libraries mentioned above. 

```shell
$ git clone https: https://github.com/abdxlahs/Space-invador
$ cd space-invader-game
$ g++ -o spaceinvader spaceinvader.cpp -lgraphics -lwinbgim -lconio
$ ./spaceinvader
```
